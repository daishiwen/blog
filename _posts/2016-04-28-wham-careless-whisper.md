<blockquote>

<pseudo:before/>

<p>I feel so unsure<br>As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor<br>As the music dies<br>Something in your eyes calls to mind the silver screens<br>And all it’s sad good-byes<br>I’m never gonna dance again<br>Guilty feet have got no rhythm<br>Though it’s easy to pretend<br>I know you are not a fool<br>Should’ve known better than to cheat a friend<br>And waste the chance that I’ve been given<br>So I’m never gonna dance again<br>The way I danced with you
</p>

<p>Time can never mend<br>The careless whispers of a good friend<br>To the heart and mind ignorance is kind<br>There’s no comfort in the truth<br>Pain is all you’ll find<br>I’m never gonna dance again<br>Guilty feet have got no rhythm<br>Though it’s easy to pretend<br>I know you are not a fool<br>Should’ve known better than to cheat a friend<br>And waste the chance that I’ve been given<br>So I’m never gonna dance again<br>The way I danced with you<br>Never without your love
</p>

<p>Tonight the music seems so loud<br>I wish that we could lose this crowd<br>Maybe it’s better this way<br>We’d hurt each other with the things we want to say<br>We could have been so good together<br>We could have lived this dance forever<br>But now who’s gonna dance with me<br>Please stay
</p>

<p>I’m never gonna dance again<br>Guilty feet have got no rhythm<br>Though it’s easy to pretend<br>I know you are not a fool<br>Should’ve known better than to cheat a friend<br>And waste the chance that I’ve been given<br>So I’m never gonna dance again<br>The way I danced with you<br>Now that U’re gone<br>Was what I did is so wrong<br>So wrong that you had to leave me alone
</p>
